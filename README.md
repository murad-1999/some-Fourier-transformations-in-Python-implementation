# some-Fourier-transformations-in-Python-implementation
Python implementation of three Fourier transforms. I'll update the Repo later to add code for interesting ideas, such as FT over a ring or a finite group, etc.

I am trying to create an extensive library of all Fourier-related implementation, in languages that are of interest to me (Py &Cpp.) You may you this file however you want.
Code is from all over, most notably, Luk Polson's repos.
